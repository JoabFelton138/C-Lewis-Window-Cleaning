                p1={`Did you know that neglected window tracks are often filled with dust and insects? Also, were you aware that a build up of debris can cause glass to become chemically etched?`}
                p2={`Not only can these issues prevent the mechanisms on your windows from working properly, but they can often aggrevate allergies that may effect you and your family.`}

                p4={`Falls can be a major hazard, therefore its much safer to leave it to a fully-insured professional. I have ladder stand offs, extension poles and have had extensive training so you donâ€™t have to take the risk!`}
                
                p5={`Aside from equipment, I also use a specialty solution designed to keep your windows looking brand-new and streak-free. I also provide a thorough inspection of the condition of your windows and examine for issues such as pane compression.`}

                p6={`If one thing's for certain, rain is never off the cards with English weather! Not to worry, I offer a three day guarantee, so if it rains within 3 days afterwards, give me a ring and I'll glady touch up any spotting that may have occurred as a result of the weather!`}
                
                subtitle4={`Sounds Good!`}
